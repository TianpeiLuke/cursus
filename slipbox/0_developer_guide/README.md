## Quick Start Summary

**New to pipeline development?** Follow this rapid orientation:

1. **Understand the Architecture**: 6-layer system - Step Specifications â†’ Script Contracts â†’ Processing Scripts â†’ Step Builders â†’ Configuration Classes â†’ Hyperparameters
2. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure you have step requirements and understand the business logic
3. **Follow the Process**: Set up workspace â†’ Create config â†’ Develop contract â†’ Create script â†’ Build specification â†’ Implement builder â†’ Register â†’ Validate â†’ Test â†’ Integrate
4. **Key Decision Points**:
   - What inputs/outputs does your step need?
   - What SageMaker step type (Processing, Training, Transform)?
   - What job type variants (training, calibration, validation)?
   - Which development approach (main workspace vs isolated project)?
5. **Essential Files to Create**:
   - `config_your_step.py` (configuration with three-tier design)
   - `your_step_contract.py` (script contract)
   - `your_script.py` (processing script with unified main function)
   - `your_step_spec.py` (step specification)
   - `builder_your_step.py` (step builder)
6. **Validation**: Use 4-tier alignment validation and Universal Step Builder Test before integration
7. **Integration**: Connect with Pipeline Catalog using Zettelkasten metadata

**Experienced developers?** Jump to [Creation Process](creation_process.md) for the complete 10-step procedure.

## Key Architectural Concepts

Our pipeline architecture follows a specification-driven approach with a modern 6-layer design:

1. **Step Specifications**: Define inputs and outputs with logical names and dependency relationships
2. **Script Contracts**: Define container paths and environment variables for script execution
3. **Processing Scripts**: Implement business logic using unified main function interface for testability
4. **Step Builders**: Connect specifications and contracts via SageMaker with UnifiedRegistryManager integration
5. **Configuration Classes**: Manage step parameters using three-tier field classification (Essential/System/Derived)
6. **Hyperparameters**: Handle ML-specific parameter tuning and optimization

**Key Modern Features**:
- **UnifiedRegistryManager**: Single consolidated registry replacing legacy patterns
- **Workspace-Aware Development**: Support for both traditional and isolated development approaches
- **4-Tier Validation**: Script-Contract, Contract-Specification, Specification-Dependencies, Builder-Configuration alignment
- **Pipeline Catalog Integration**: Zettelkasten-inspired discovery with connection-based relationships

Understanding these layers and their relationships is crucial for successful step development in the modern architecture.
