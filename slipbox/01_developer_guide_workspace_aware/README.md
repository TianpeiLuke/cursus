# Workspace-Aware Pipeline Step Developer Guide

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for developing new steps in isolated project environments using our workspace-aware development approach. This guide is specifically designed for developers working in `development/projects/*/src/cursus_dev/` with hybrid registry access to both shared (`src/cursus`) and project-specific code.

## Overview

The workspace-aware developer guide supports **Isolated Project Development**, where developers work in dedicated project environments with:

- **Isolated development environment** with project-specific code in `src/cursus_dev/`
- **Hybrid access** to both shared (`src/cursus`) and custom (`src/cursus_dev`) code
- **Project-specific responsibility** with controlled integration points
- **Workspace-aware testing** with registry context management
- **Registry context**: Project-specific workspace with fallback to shared components

## Recent Updates (September 2025)

ðŸ†• **New Workspace-Aware Documentation**: This guide has been created to complement the main developer guide with workspace-specific patterns:

- **UnifiedRegistryManager Integration**: Workspace-aware registry usage with project context
- **Isolated Project Development**: Complete workflow for `development/projects/*/` structure
- **Hybrid Code Access**: Patterns for accessing both shared and project-specific components
- **Workspace CLI Integration**: Project management commands and validation tools
- **Cross-Workspace Testing**: Testing strategies for isolated development environments

## Quick Start Summary

**New to workspace-aware development?** Follow this rapid orientation:

1. **Initialize Project Workspace**: Use `cursus init-workspace --project your_project --type isolated`
2. **Understand Isolated Architecture**: Same 6-layer system but with project-specific code in `src/cursus_dev/`
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Configure workspace context and hybrid registry access
4. **Key Decision Points**:
   - What project-specific functionality do you need?
   - Which shared components from `src/cursus` will you use?
   - How will your project-specific code integrate with shared systems?
   - What testing strategy fits your isolated development needs?
5. **Essential Project Files to Create**:
   - `src/cursus_dev/steps/config_your_step.py` (project-specific configuration)
   - `src/cursus_dev/steps/your_step_contract.py` (project script contract)
   - `src/cursus_dev/steps/scripts/your_script.py` (project processing script)
   - `src/cursus_dev/steps/your_step_spec.py` (project step specification)
   - `src/cursus_dev/steps/builders/builder_your_step.py` (project step builder)
6. **Workspace Validation**: Use workspace-aware validation with `cursus validate-alignment --workspace your_project`
7. **Integration Testing**: Test hybrid registry integration and cross-workspace compatibility

## Recommended Reading Order

For developers new to workspace-aware development, we recommend this reading order:

1. Start with **[Workspace Setup Guide](ws_workspace_setup_guide.md)** to initialize your project environment
2. Read **[Adding a New Pipeline Step (Workspace-Aware)](ws_adding_new_pipeline_step.md)** for an overview of isolated project development
3. Review the **[Creation Process (Workspace-Aware)](ws_creation_process.md)** for the complete workflow
4. Study **[Hybrid Registry Integration](ws_hybrid_registry_integration.md)** to understand registry usage patterns
5. Learn **[Shared Code Access Patterns](ws_shared_code_access_patterns.md)** for accessing `src/cursus` components

   - **[Component Guide (Workspace-Aware)](ws_component_guide.md)**
   - **[Step Builder Implementation (Workspace-Aware)](ws_step_builder.md)**
   - **[Step Builder Registry Guide (Workspace-Aware)](ws_step_builder_registry_guide.md)**
7. Master workspace-specific tools:

## Key Architectural Concepts for Isolated Projects

Our workspace-aware architecture maintains the same 6-layer design but with project-specific implementation:

1. **Step Specifications**: Project-specific definitions in `src/cursus_dev/steps/`
2. **Script Contracts**: Project container paths and environment variables
3. **Processing Scripts**: Project business logic in `src/cursus_dev/steps/scripts/`
4. **Step Builders**: Project builders with hybrid registry integration
5. **Configuration Classes**: Project-specific config with shared component access
6. **Hyperparameters**: Project ML parameters with shared base classes

**Key Workspace-Aware Features**:
- **Hybrid Registry Access**: Automatic fallback from project-specific to shared components
- **Workspace Context Management**: Isolated development with controlled integration points
- **Cross-Workspace Testing**: Validation across project and shared code boundaries
- **CLI Workspace Management**: Automated project setup, validation, and integration tools

## Development Workflow Comparison

### Traditional Main Workspace (`src/cursus/`)
- Direct modification of shared codebase
- Immediate integration with all existing components
- Shared responsibility for system stability
- Global impact of changes

### Isolated Project Workspace (`development/projects/*/`)
- Project-specific code in dedicated `src/cursus_dev/` directory
- Controlled access to shared components via hybrid registry
- Project-specific responsibility with integration checkpoints
- Isolated development with optional integration
