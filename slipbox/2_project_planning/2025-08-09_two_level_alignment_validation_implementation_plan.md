## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the development and deployment of a two-level alignment validation system that combines LLM agents with strict validation tools. The system addresses the fundamental limitation of current validation approaches: they are either too rigid (leading to false positives) or too flexible (leading to unrigorous validation).

**Target Outcomes**:
- False Positive Rate: < 5% (vs current 100% in some levels)
- False Negative Rate: < 2% (maintain strict enforcement)
- Validation Coverage: > 95% of alignment rules
