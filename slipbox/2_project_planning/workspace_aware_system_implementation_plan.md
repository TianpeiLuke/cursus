# Workspace-Aware System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan to convert the current Cursus validation and registry systems into a developer workspace-aware architecture. The plan is based on the designs specified in the Workspace-Aware Validation System Design, Multi-Developer Workspace Management System, and Distributed Registry System Design documents.

## Project Scope

### Primary Objectives
1. **Enable Workspace-Aware Validation**: Extend existing validation frameworks to support isolated developer workspaces
2. **Implement Distributed Registry**: Transform centralized registry into distributed, workspace-aware system
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing code continues to work without modification
4. **Provide Core Extension Mechanisms**: Focus on shared infrastructure that enables user innovation

### Core Architectural Principles
- **Principle 1: Workspace Isolation** - Everything within a developer's workspace stays in that workspace
- **Principle 2: Shared Core** - Only code within `src/cursus/` is shared for all workspaces

## Implementation Phases
