# Developer Guide Workspace-Aware Documentation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive update strategy for developer documentation to support the fully implemented hybrid registry system and workspace-aware development workflows. The plan addresses two distinct development approaches:

1. **Main Workspace Development**: Developers working directly in `src/cursus/` (traditional approach)
2. **Isolated Project Development**: Developers working in `development/projects/*/src/cursus_dev/` with hybrid registry access

## Background Context

### Current State Analysis

The hybrid registry system implementation is complete (Phases 0-5) with significant achievements:
- **54% code reduction** (2,837 → 1,285 lines)
- **UnifiedRegistryManager** providing drop-in registry replacement
- **Workspace-aware step resolution** with simple workspace priority
- **CLI workspace management** commands (`init-workspace`, `list-steps --workspace`)
- **Consolidated workspace system** with 26 components and 5-level validation

### Comprehensive Codebase Alignment Analysis

A detailed analysis has been conducted and documented in `slipbox/4_analysis/2025-09-05_developer_guide_codebase_alignment_analysis.md`. This analysis identifies critical gaps between current developer guide documentation and the implemented codebase.

#### Key Findings from Analysis

1. **Registry System Evolution Gap**: Documentation still references legacy `@register_builder` patterns while codebase uses `UnifiedRegistryManager`
2. **Workspace-Aware Development Missing**: New workspace isolation capabilities implemented but not documented
3. **Validation Framework Documentation Gap**: Extensive 4-tier alignment validation system exists but lacks documentation
4. **CLI Integration Missing**: Rich workspace CLI commands exist but not integrated into developer workflows

#### Impact Assessment

The documentation gaps create significant barriers to developer productivity:
- Developers following current guides will use deprecated patterns
- Modern workspace-aware capabilities remain undiscovered
- Manual processes used instead of automated CLI workflows
- Critical validation capabilities underutilized

### Documentation Gap Analysis

Current developer guides in `slipbox/0_developer_guide/` are outdated and lack:
- Workspace awareness concepts
- Hybrid registry integration patterns
- Multi-project development workflows
- Modern CLI tooling usage
- Isolated development environment setup

## Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Update Existing Developer Guide (slipbox/0_developer_guide) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Target Audience**: Developers working directly in main workspace (`src/cursus/`)
**Timeline**: 2 weeks ✅ **COMPLETED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE**
**Scope**: Modernize existing documentation for hybrid registry system ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - All major developer guide documents have been comprehensively updated with:
- UnifiedRegistryManager integration and workspace-aware patterns
- 6-layer architecture (enhanced from 4-layer system)
- Script development integration with unified main function interface
- Pipeline catalog integration with Zettelkasten-inspired discovery
- Component relationship refinement with precise input/output mapping patterns
- Workspace-aware validation framework documentation
- Modern CLI tooling integration
- Consistent documentation structure with cross-references

### Phase 2: Create Workspace-Aware Developer Guide (slipbox/01_developer_guide_workspace_aware)
**Target Audience**: Developers working in isolated projects (`development/projects/*/`)
**Timeline**: 3 weeks

#### Isolated Step Creation Process

## Creating Steps in Isolated Projects

### Step Creation Workflow (project/src/cursus_dev/steps)
```python
# File: development/projects/project_delta/src/cursus_dev/steps/my_custom_step.py

from cursus.core.step import Step
from cursus.registry.hybrid.manager import UnifiedRegistryManager

class MyCustomStep(Step):
    """Custom step implementation in isolated project environment."""
    
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.project_specific_param = config.get('project_param')
    
    def execute(self, input_data):
        # Project-specific step logic
        processed_data = self._custom_processing(input_data)
        return processed_data
    
    def _custom_processing(self, data):
        # Custom logic specific to this project
        return data

# Register step in project workspace
registry = UnifiedRegistryManager()
registry.set_workspace_context("project_delta")
registry.register_step("my_custom_step", MyCustomStep)
```

### Step Builder Creation (project/src/cursus_dev/steps/builders)
```python
# File: development/projects/project_delta/src/cursus_dev/steps/builders/my_custom_step_builder.py

from cursus.core.step_builder import StepBuilder
from ..my_custom_step import MyCustomStep

class MyCustomStepBuilder(StepBuilder):
    """Builder for project-specific custom step."""
    
    def build_step(self, config):
        return MyCustomStep(config)
    
    def validate_config(self, config):
        # Project-specific validation logic
        required_fields = ['project_param', 'input_path']
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in config:
                raise ValueError(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return True

# Register builder in project workspace
registry = UnifiedRegistryManager()
registry.set_workspace_context("project_delta")
registry.register_step_builder("my_custom_step", MyCustomStepBuilder)
```

#### Hybrid Registry Usage Patterns
```markdown
## Registry Access Patterns

### Accessing Shared Components
```python
# Access shared steps from src/cursus
registry = UnifiedRegistryManager()
registry.set_workspace_context("project_delta")

# Shared step (from src/cursus)
shared_step = registry.get_step_builder("preprocessing_step")

# Project-specific step (from src/cursus_dev)
custom_step = registry.get_step_builder("project_delta_custom_step")
```

### Resolution Priority
1. Project-specific code (`src/cursus_dev`)
2. Shared code (`src/cursus`)
3. Fallback to default implementations
```

#### Development Workflow Integration
```markdown
## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Workspace Activation
```bash
cd development/projects/project_delta
cursus activate-workspace project_delta
```

### 2. Development Cycle
- Edit code in `src/cursus_dev/`
- Access shared utilities from `src/cursus/`
- Test with workspace-aware registry
- Validate integration with shared components

### 3. Testing and Validation
```bash
# Run project-specific tests
cursus test --workspace project_delta

# Validate registry integration
cursus validate-registry --workspace project_delta

# Check for conflicts with shared code
cursus check-conflicts --workspace project_delta
```

- **Shared responsibility** for code quality and compatibility
- **Traditional testing** patterns with full system access
- **Registry context**: Default "main" workspace

### Isolated Project Development (`development/projects/*/`)
- **Isolated development environment** with project-specific code
- **Hybrid access** to both shared (`src/cursus`) and custom (`src/cursus_dev`) code
- **Project-specific responsibility** with controlled integration points
- **Workspace-aware testing** with registry context management
- **Registry context**: Project-specific workspace with fallback to shared
