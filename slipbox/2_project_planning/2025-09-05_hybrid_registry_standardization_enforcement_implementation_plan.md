# Hybrid Registry Standardization Enforcement Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development of a **simplified standardization enforcement system** for the hybrid registry architecture. Based on comprehensive redundancy analysis, the project focuses on **essential validation for new step creation** while avoiding over-engineering identified in the original design.

**Project Duration**: 2 weeks (14 days) - **Reduced from 4 weeks**
**Team Size**: 1-2 developers - **Reduced from 2-3 developers**
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: Medium - **Reduced from Medium-High**

### **Redundancy Analysis Integration**

This plan incorporates findings from the **Step Definition Standardization Enforcement Design Redundancy Analysis**, which identified:
- **30-35% redundancy** in the original comprehensive design
- **Over-engineering concerns** with 1,200+ lines vs 200 lines needed
- **Performance impact**: 100x slower validation overhead
- **Unfound demand**: 60-70% of features address theoretical problems

**Optimization Strategy**: Focus on **15-20% redundancy target** with simplified implementation addressing **validated needs only**.
