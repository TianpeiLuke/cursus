# CLI Pipeline Compilation Tools Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the project plan for implementing the CLI Pipeline Compilation Tools as described in the [CLI Pipeline Compilation Tools Design](../1_design/cli_pipeline_compilation_tools_design.md) document.

2. Integrate with existing pipeline catalog system for project templates
3. Provide comprehensive validation and error reporting
4. Enable automated pipeline compilation and execution document generation
5. Maintain compatibility with existing development CLI tools
6. Follow docker subfolder structure patterns for generated projects
