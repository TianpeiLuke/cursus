# Validation Framework Analysis: Alignment and Builders

## Overview

This analysis examines the validation framework components under `src/cursus/validation/alignment` and `src/cursus/validation/builders`. These modules form a comprehensive validation system that ensures consistency and compliance across the cursus pipeline architecture through multi-level alignment testing and universal step builder validation.

## Directory Structure Analysis

### Alignment Module (`src/cursus/validation/alignment`)

The alignment module provides comprehensive validation of alignment rules between scripts, contracts, specifications, and builders across four distinct levels:

1. **Script ↔ Contract Alignment** (Level 1)
2. **Contract ↔ Specification Alignment** (Level 2)  
3. **Specification ↔ Dependencies Alignment** (Level 3)
4. **Builder ↔ Configuration Alignment** (Level 4)

### Builders Module (`src/cursus/validation/builders`)

The builders module provides a universal testing framework for validating step builder implementations across multiple architectural levels with integrated scoring and reporting capabilities.
