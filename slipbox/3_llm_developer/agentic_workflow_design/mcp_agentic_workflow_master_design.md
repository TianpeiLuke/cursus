## Core Design Principles

### 1. Agent Separation
Each agent role runs as an independent MCP server, enabling:
- Independent scaling based on demand
- Fault isolation and recovery
- Technology stack flexibility per agent
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Tool Standardization
Consistent tool interfaces across all agents provide:
- Predictable interaction patterns
- Easy integration and testing
- Simplified orchestration logic
- Clear API contracts

### 3. Resource Centralization
Shared access to knowledge base and examples ensures:
- Consistent knowledge across agents
- Efficient resource utilization
- Centralized knowledge management
- Version control for knowledge assets

### 4. Workflow Orchestration
Centralized workflow state management enables:
- Reliable workflow execution
- Recovery from failures
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Human intervention coordination

### 5. Human Integration
Standardized human-in-the-loop interfaces support:
- Consistent user experience
- Flexible approval workflows
- Timeout and escalation handling
- Context-aware interactions

## Workflow Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Plan Development and Validation
1. **Initial Planning**: Requirements analysis and plan generation
2. **Plan Validation**: LLM-based validation of implementation plan
3. **Plan Revision**: Iterative refinement based on validation feedback
4. **Human Review**: Human approval of validated plan
5. **Phase Transition**: Move to implementation phase

### Phase 2: Code Implementation and Validation
6. **Code Implementation**: Generate all step components from validated plan
7. **Code Validation**: Two-level validation with deterministic tools
8. **Code Refinement**: Fix issues identified by validation
9. **Final Review**: Human approval of validated implementation
10. **Workflow Completion**: Finalize and document completed workflow

## Key Benefits

### Scalability and Modularity
- **Independent Scaling**: Each agent can be scaled based on demand
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to update, replace, or extend individual agents
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal resource allocation per agent type
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different agents can use different technologies

### Reliability and Robustness
- **Fault Isolation**: Agent failures don't cascade to other agents
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry and fallback strategies
- **State Persistence**: Workflow state survives system restarts
- **Human Escalation**: Graceful degradation to human intervention

### Quality Assurance
- **Two-Level Validation**: Combines LLM analysis with deterministic tools
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Validates all aspects of implementation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops
- **Human Oversight**: Critical decision points require human approval
