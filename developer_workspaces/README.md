# Developer Workspaces

This directory implements the **Workspace-Aware System Architecture** as defined in the workspace_aware_system_master_design. It provides isolated development environments for multiple developers while maintaining shared core functionality.

## Architecture Principles

### Workspace Isolation Principle
> "Everything that happens within a developer's workspace stays in that workspace"

Each developer workspace is completely isolated, allowing:
- Independent step implementations
- Isolated testing environments
- Separate validation reports
- No cross-workspace interference

### Shared Core Principle
> "Only code within src/cursus/ is shared for all workspaces"

The shared core in `src/cursus/` provides:
- Common pipeline framework
- Shared validation systems
- Core abstractions and interfaces
- Registry and discovery mechanisms

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Developer Collaboration
- Each developer gets their own isolated workspace
- Independent development of pipeline steps
- No conflicts between developer implementations

### 2. Workspace-Aware Pipeline Assembly
- Dynamic discovery of step implementations across workspaces
- Workspace-specific pipeline compilation
- Cross-workspace component validation

### 3. Integration Staging System
- Controlled pathway from workspace to production
- Integration validation and testing
- Staged deployment process

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
- Workspace-level validation
- Cross-workspace compatibility checks
- Integration validation pipeline

## Usage

### Creating a New Developer Workspace

1. Create a new directory under `developers/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p developers/developer_name
   ```

2. Set up the workspace structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p developers/developer_name/src/cursus_dev/steps/{builders,configs,contracts,specs,scripts}
   mkdir -p developers/developer_name/{test,validation_reports}
   ```

3. Implement your step components in the appropriate directories

### Workspace Management

The workspace manager provides:
- Workspace discovery and registration
- Cross-workspace component discovery
- Workspace validation coordination
- Integration staging management

### Integration Process

1. **Development**: Work in isolated developer workspace
2. **Validation**: Run workspace-specific validation
3. **Staging**: Move to integration staging for cross-workspace testing
4. **Integration**: Validate compatibility with other workspaces
5. **Production**: Deploy to shared core if validation passes

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Keep all development within your workspace
2. **Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for step implementations
3. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive tests in your workspace test directory
4. **Documentation**: Document your step implementations and contracts
5. **Validation**: Run workspace validation before integration staging
