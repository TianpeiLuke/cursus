# Developer Workspace: developer_1

This workspace was migrated from the legacy pipeline_testing structure.

## Directory Structure

- `inputs/` - Input data for pipeline steps
- `outputs/` - Output data from pipeline steps  
- `local_data/` - Local test data files
- `s3_data/` - Downloaded S3 data for testing
- `synthetic_data/` - Generated synthetic test data
- `logs/` - Execution logs
- `metadata/` - Pipeline execution metadata
- `test/` - Developer-specific tests
- `validation_reports/` - Validation reports
- `src/cursus_dev/steps/` - Developer step implementations (to be created)

## Migration Information

- Migrated from: /Users/tianpeixie/github_workspace/cursus/pipeline_testing
- Migration date: 1756792404.2966402
- Target developer: developer_1

## Next Steps

1. Review migrated data for completeness
2. Update any hardcoded paths in scripts to use the new structure
3. Create step implementations in `src/cursus_dev/steps/` as needed
4. Test workspace functionality with the new structure
