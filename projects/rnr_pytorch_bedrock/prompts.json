Carefully review all provided data\n2. Identify key patterns and indicators\n3. Match against category criteria\n4. Select the most appropriate category\n5. Validate evidence against conditions and exceptions\n6. Provide confidence assessment and reasoning\n\nDecision Criteria:\n- Base decisions on explicit evidence in the data\n- Consider all category conditions and exceptions\n- Choose the category with the strongest evidence match\n- Provide clear reasoning for your classification\n\nReasoning Requirements:\n- Explain WHY the evidence supports the selected category\n- Address HOW the evidence aligns with category conditions\n- Clarify WHAT makes this category the best match\n- Describe WHY other categories were ruled out (if applicable)\n\nKey Evidence Validation:\n- Evidence MUST align with at least one condition for the selected category\n- Evidence MUST NOT match any exceptions listed for the selected category\n- Evidence should reference specific content from the input data\n- Multiple pieces of supporting evidence strengthen the classification\n\n## Classification Guidelines\n\n### 1. Output Format Requirements\n\n**Category Selection:**\n- Choose exactly ONE category from the provided list\n- Category name must match exactly (case-sensitive)\n\n**Confidence Score:**\n- Provide as decimal number between 0.00 and 1.00 (e.g., 0.95)\n- Base confidence for complete data: 0.7-1.0\n- Missing one field: reduce by 0.1-0.2\n- Missing two fields: reduce by 0.2-0.3\n- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.5\n\n### 2. Shiptrack Parsing Rules\n\n**Multiple Shipment Structure:**\n- Multiple shipment sequences separated by shipment IDs\n- Each sequence starts with \"[bom] [Shipment ID]:* [eom]\"\n\n**Analysis Approach:**\n- Process each shipment sequence separately\n- Compare delivery events (EVENT_301) across all sequences\n\n**Key Event Codes:**\n- EVENT_301: Delivery confirmation\n- EVENT_302: Out for delivery\n- EVENT_201: Arrival at facility\n\n### 3. Missing Data Handling\n\n**When Dialogue is Empty but Shiptrack Exists:**\n- Focus on shipping events and timeline\n- Reduce confidence score by 0.1-0.2\n\n**When Shiptrack is Empty but Dialogue Exists:**\n- Focus on message content and reported issues\n- Reduce confidence score by 0.1-0.2\n\n### 4. Category Priority Hierarchy\n\n**Tier 1: Abuse Pattern Categories (Highest Priority)**\n- PDA_Undeliverable: Verify no delivery + refund given\n- PDA_Early_Refund: Verify refund before delivery\n\n**Tier 2: Delivery Status Categories**\n- TrueDNR: Delivered but disputed\n- Confirmed_Delay: External factors confirmed\n\n### 5. Evidence Requirements\n\n**Message Evidence Must Include:**\n- Direct quotes from dialogue with speaker identification\n\n**Shipping Evidence Must Include:**\n- All tracking events listed chronologically\n\n**Timeline Evidence Must Show:**\n- Clear chronological sequence of events\n\n\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**CRITICAL: Follow this exact format for automated parsing**\n\n```\n1. Category: One of: TrueDNR, Confirmed_Delay, Delivery_Attempt_Failed, ... (see full list above)\n\n2. Confidence Score: Number between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.85)\n\n3.

Reasoning: [REASONING]\n\n   * Primary Factors:\n     - Main reason\n   * Supporting Evidence:\n     - Supporting detail\n   * Contradicting Evidence:\n     - None\n\n```\n\n**Field Descriptions:**\n- **Category**: Exactly one category from the predefined list (case-sensitive match required)\n- **Confidence Score**: Decimal number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicating classification certainty\n- **Key Evidence**: Three subsections: Message Evidence, Shipping Evidence, Timeline Evidence - each with [sep] token separators\n- **Reasoning**: Three subsections: Primary Factors, Supporting Evidence, Contradicting Evidence - each with [sep] token separators\n\n**Formatting Rules:**\n- Use exact section headers with numbers and colons\n- No semicolons (;) anywhere in response\n\n**Validation Requirements:**\n- Category must match exactly from predefined list\n- Confidence score must be decimal format (e.g., 0.85, not 85%)\n- Each evidence item must start with '[sep] ' token\n\n**Evidence Validation:**\n- Message Evidence must include direct quotes with speaker identification\n- Shipping Evidence must include tracking events with timestamps\n- Timeline Evidence must show chronological sequence of events\n- All evidence must reference specific content from input data\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```\n1. Category: TrueDNR\n\n2. Confidence Score: 0.92\n\n3. Key Evidence:\n   * Message Evidence:\n     - [BUYER]: Hello, I have not received my package\n     - [BUYER]: But I did not find any package, please refund me\n   * Shipping Evidence:\n     - [Event Time]: 2025-02-21T17:40:49.323Z [Event]: Delivered\n     - No further shipping events after delivery confirmation\n   * Timeline Evidence:\n     - Delivery confirmation on 2025-02-21 17:40\n     - Buyer reports non-receipt starting 2025-02-25 07:14\n\n4. Reasoning:\n   * Primary Factors:\n     - Tracking shows package was delivered successfully\n     - Buyer explicitly states they did not receive the package\n   * Supporting Evidence:\n     - Buyer requests refund due to missing package\n     - No evidence of buyer receiving wrong/defective item\n   * Contradicting Evidence:\n     - None\n```",
