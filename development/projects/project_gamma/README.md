# Project Gamma - Isolated Development Workspace

## Overview

This is an isolated development workspace for **Project Gamma**, implementing the **Workspace Isolation Principle** from the Multi-Project Workspace Management System. Everything that happens within this workspace stays contained within this workspace, ensuring complete isolation from other projects and the main codebase.

## Purpose

Project Gamma serves as an isolated development environment where contributors can:

- Develop and test new step builders and pipeline components
- Experiment with code changes without affecting the main codebase or other projects
- Validate implementations using the comprehensive validation framework
- Prepare code for integration through the quality review process

## Workspace Structure

This workspace follows the standardized project structure defined in the Multi-Project Workspace Management System:

```
project_gamma/
├── README.md                           # This documentation
├── src/                               # Project's code directory
│   └── cursus_dev/                    # Project's cursus extensions
│       └── steps/                     # New step implementations
│           ├── builders/              # Step builders

│           ├── contracts/             # Script contracts
│           ├── specs/                 # Step specifications
│           └── scripts/               # Processing scripts
├── test/                              # Project's test suite and data
└── validation_reports/                # Workspace validation results and reports
```

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Workspace Isolation
- **Complete Isolation**: All development activities remain within this workspace
- **No Cross-Workspace Dependencies**: No dependencies on other project workspaces
- **Independent Registry**: Maintains its own component registry and validation results
- **Contained Experiments**: All code changes and experiments stay within workspace boundaries

### Principle 2: Shared Core Foundation
- **Inherits from `src/cursus/`**: All shared core functionality is available
- **Common Validation Frameworks**: Uses UnifiedAlignmentTester and UniversalStepBuilderTest
- **Shared Base Classes**: Inherits all base classes, utilities, and templates
- **Integration Pathway**: Clear path from workspace to shared core through review process

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Workspace (When Available)
```bash
# Create and initialize the workspace
python -m cursus.project_tools create-workspace --project-id "project_gamma" --type "standard"
cd development/projects/project_gamma
python -m cursus.project_tools init-workspace
```

### 2. Validate Workspace Setup
```bash
# Ensure workspace is properly configured
python -m cursus.project_tools validate-workspace
```

### 3. Development Workflow
```bash
# Develop new components following the development guide
# Create step configuration, contract, specification, and builder

# Run local validation
python -m cursus.project_tools validate-code --level all

# Run step builder tests
python -m cursus.project_tools test-builders --verbose

# Generate validation report
python -m cursus.project_tools generate-report
```

## Validation Framework

This workspace uses a comprehensive 5-level validation system:

### Level 1: Workspace Integrity
- Validates workspace structure and configuration
- Ensures required files and directories exist
- Checks workspace metadata and documentation

### Level 2: Code Quality
- Extends existing alignment validation to project code
- Validates naming conventions and architectural compliance
- Ensures adherence to development guide standards

### Level 3: Functional Validation
- Runs Universal Step Builder Tests on project implementations
- Validates step builders, configurations, contracts, and specifications
- Ensures compatibility with existing pipeline infrastructure

### Level 4: Integration Validation
- Tests integration with main codebase
- Validates that project code doesn't break existing functionality
- Ensures proper registry integration and dependency resolution

### Level 5: End-to-End Validation
- Creates test pipelines using project steps
- Validates complete workflow from configuration to execution
- Performance and resource usage validation

## Quality Review Process

When code is ready for integration:

### 1. Submit for Review
```bash
# Submit validated code for review
python -m cursus.project_tools submit-for-review --components "steps/builders/my_new_step.py"
```

### 2. Review Process
- Code is moved to `development/review/pending/` for evaluation
- Comprehensive validation ensures compatibility with shared core
- Review reports are generated in `development/review/reports/`

### 3. Integration
- Successful components graduate from workspace isolation to shared core
- Final integration is performed by maintainers
- Integrated code becomes available to all workspaces

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow the existing Cursus architectural patterns
- Maintain clear separation between builders, configs, contracts, specs, and scripts
- Use proper naming conventions as defined in the development guide

### Testing Requirements
- All step builders must pass Universal Step Builder Tests
- Integration tests should validate compatibility with existing components
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

### Quality Standards
- Code must pass all validation levels before review submission
- Follow the validation checklist for quality assurance
- Maintain high test coverage and comprehensive documentation

## Workspace Configuration

Each workspace includes a `workspace_config.yaml` file defining:

```yaml
workspace:
  project_id: "project_gamma"
  project_owner: "development_team"
  contributors: []
  created_date: "2025-09-04"
  workspace_type: "standard"
  version: "1.0"

validation:
  alignment_validation: true
  builder_validation: true
  integration_validation: true
  e2e_validation: false

review:
  auto_submit: false
  require_approval: true
  target_branch: "main"

**Note**: This workspace implements the Workspace Isolation Principle - all development activities remain contained within this environment until ready for integration through the quality review process.
