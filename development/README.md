# Development Workspace

This directory contains the development workspace structure for the Cursus pipeline system.

## Structure

```
development/
├── projects/
│   ├── project_alpha/    # Development project Alpha (formerly developer_1)
│   ├── project_beta/     # Development project Beta (formerly developer_2)
│   └── project_gamma/    # Development project Gamma (formerly developer_3)
└── review/
    ├── pending/          # Components pending review (formerly staging_areas)
    ├── reports/          # Integration and review reports (formerly integration_reports)
    └── validation/       # Validation results and testing (formerly validation_results)
```

## Project Structure

Each project directory (`project_alpha`, `project_beta`, `project_gamma`) contains:
- Pipeline components and configurations
- Project-specific scripts and utilities
- Development artifacts and documentation

## Review Process

The `review/` directory manages the review and integration process:

### pending/
- Components awaiting review
- Staged changes ready for integration
- Pre-review validation artifacts

### reports/
- Integration test reports
- Code review summaries
- Quality assessment reports

### validation/
- Validation test results
- Compliance check outputs
- Performance benchmarks

## Usage

### Working on a Project
```bash
cd development/projects/project_alpha
# Develop your pipeline components here
```

### Submitting for Review
```bash
# Move components to review staging
cp -r project_alpha/new_component development/review/pending/
```

### Checking Review Status
```bash
# Check reports and validation results
ls development/review/reports/
ls development/review/validation/
```

## Migration Notes

This structure replaces the previous `developer_workspaces/` structure:
- `developers/developer_1/` → `projects/project_alpha/`
- `developers/developer_2/` → `projects/project_beta/`
- `developers/developer_3/` → `projects/project_gamma/`
- `integration_staging/staging_areas/` → `review/pending/`
- `integration_staging/integration_reports/` → `review/reports/`
- `integration_staging/validation_results/` → `review/validation/`

## Integration with Cursus Workspace System

This development structure integrates with the Cursus workspace management system:

```python
from cursus.workspace import WorkspaceAPI

# Initialize API with development directory
api = WorkspaceAPI(base_path="development")

# Work with projects
api.setup_developer_workspace("project_alpha")
api.validate_workspace("development/projects/project_alpha")
